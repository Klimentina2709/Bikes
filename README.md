This repository showcases a bike-themed web page created twice during my front-end development learning journey. I initially built the page using vanilla JavaScript and plain CSS, and then later recreated it using React and Bootstrap when I was first introduced to component-based development. It was a valuable learning experience, demonstrating my growth from basic web development to more advanced concepts.

## Introduction and Branches

The Bike Page Project represents my progression as a front-end developer. I started with a basic implementation using vanilla JavaScript and plain CSS, learning to create dynamic content and make AJAX requests. Later, I revisited the project to rebuild it with React, introducing myself to component-based architecture, state management, and using Bootstrap for responsive styling.

The repository contains two branches:

- **[Vanilla_JavaScript_Page](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/Bikes/tree/Vanilla_JavaScript_Page)**: The original version using plain JavaScript and CSS. This branch contains the first implementation of the project. It uses vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content generation, with basic styling done in plain CSS. It was my initial attempt at front-end development, making use of the `fetch` API for the first time to get data from an external source.

- **[React_Page](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/Bikes/tree/React_Page)**: The updated version using React and Bootstrap. This branch represents the second version of the project, which I created when I started learning React. It employs component-based development, state management, and Bootstrap for responsive design. This version showcases a more advanced approach, reflecting my growth in skills and understanding of front-end development.

## Learning Experience

Working on the Bike Page Project twice provided me with a fantastic learning experience:

- üöÄ **Vanilla JavaScript Version**: Helped me understand the basics of front-end development, including dynamic content creation, basic styling, and making AJAX requests.
- ‚öõÔ∏è **React Version**: Allowed me to practice using components, manage state effectively, and apply modern styling with Bootstrap. It also reinforced the concepts of code reusability and maintainability in a more structured way.

Revisiting the project using React gave me a deeper appreciation for the benefits of component-based architecture and how it simplifies complex web applications.

You can clone the repository and switch branches using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Klimentina2709/Bikes.git

# Switch to the Vanilla JavaScript version
git checkout Vanilla_JavaScript_Page

# Switch to the React version
git checkout React_Page
```
